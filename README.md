1-coin_flip_simulation: 
* simple python script for simulating fair coin 
-also unfair coin in included

2- Quiskit: 
* demonstrates a basic quantum circuit that prepares a single qubit in a superposition state using the Hadamard gate, 
* then measures it and visualizes the results. 
* It uses one quantum and one classical register, applies a Hadamard gate to the qubit (putting it into a 50-50 superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩), and measures the qubit into a classical bit. 
* The circuit is executed 1024 times using Qiskit AerSimulator to generate statistical outcomes, which are then displayed as a histogram.
*  The `if_test` section is commented out but shows how to apply a second Hadamard gate conditionally based on the first measurement result, offering a starting point for implementing quantum control flow.
